# App Flow Document for Inventory-Sales Application

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first arrives, they land on a clean sign-in page that also offers a link to register a new account. To sign up, the user clicks the registration link and sees fields for their name, email, password, and password confirmation. After filling in these details, the user submits the form and receives a confirmation message. If email verification is enabled, the user will click a link in the email to verify their address before they can fully access the application. To sign in, the user returns to the sign-in page, enters their email and password, and clicks the sign-in button. Once authenticated, the user is redirected to the main dashboard. If the user ever forgets their password, they can click the “Forgot Password” link, enter their email address, and receive a reset link by email. Following that link allows the user to choose a new password, after which they can sign in normally. Signing out is available via a logout option in the user menu located in the header, which immediately ends the session and returns the user to the sign-in page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After logging in for the first time, the user lands on the dashboard home page. The header displays the application logo on the left, followed by a notification icon and a user menu on the right. The sidebar on the left contains links to all major sections: Dashboard, Products, Quotations, Sales Orders, Invoices, Inventory, Reports, Settings, and User Management. The central area of the dashboard shows an overview of key metrics such as total sales, current stock alerts, and pending quotations. At the top of this central area, the user can see date filters and a refresh action. Notifications drop down from the header icon, showing recent alerts like low-stock warnings or pending approvals. From this dashboard, clicking on any sidebar link navigates the user to the corresponding section while preserving the sidebar and header for consistent navigation.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

### Product Management Flow

When the user selects Products from the sidebar, they see a list of all products in a table view with columns for name, SKU, category, price, stock level, and status. To add a new product, the user clicks the create button at the top of the page, which opens a form in a modal. The form includes fields for product name, description, category selection, pricing details, minimum and maximum stock thresholds, and initial stock quantity. Submitting the form sends the data to the backend, which returns a success message and refreshes the product list. To edit an existing product, the user clicks the edit icon on a product row, modifies any details in the same modal form, and saves. The product list updates immediately to reflect changes. If the user wishes to archive or delete a product, they use a delete action that triggers a confirmation prompt and, on confirmation, sends a delete request to the API. After archiving or deleting, the product no longer appears in the active list but can be viewed in an archived products filter.

### Quotation Creation and Approval Flow

The user clicks Quotations in the sidebar to open a paginated list of all quotations. To start a new quotation, they click the new quotation button, which opens a multi-step form page. In the first step, the user selects a customer or creates a new customer on the fly, then adds line items by selecting products, entering quantities, and viewing real-time pricing based on settings. The user clicks Next to go to the approval settings step, where they choose the approval chain defined for their role. Submitting the form saves the quotation in a pending state. The system then notifies the next approver in the chain. Approvers receive a notification and can click the notification to view the quotation details, approve or reject it with comments. Upon final approval, the quotation status changes to approved and a button appears to convert it into a sales order. At any stage, the user can filter the list by status: draft, pending approval, approved, or rejected.

### Sales Order and Invoice Generation Flow

From an approved quotation, the user clicks the Convert button to transform it into a new sales order. This action opens a sales order page populated with the quotation’s data. The user reviews the details, adds shipping information, and confirms the order. Once confirmed, the system creates the sales order record and provides a button to generate the invoice. Clicking Generate Invoice moves the user to the invoice form page, where they can select payment terms, due dates, and tax settings. After submitting, the system generates a PDF and marks the invoice as open. The invoice list view shows all invoices grouped by status such as open, paid, or overdue. Users can view, download, or email the PDF directly from the invoice detail page.

### Inventory Control and Stock Movements Flow

When Inventory is selected in the sidebar, the user sees four tabs: Goods Receipts, Stock Movements, Picking Lists, and Stock Alerts. Under Goods Receipts, the user clicks New Receipt, fills in supplier details, selects products with received quantities, and submits. This creates stock entries in the system. Under Stock Movements, the user can create manual adjustments or transfers between locations by specifying product, from-location, to-location, and quantity, then submitting the movement form. Picking Lists allows warehouse staff to view pending sales orders that require picking. Clicking Create Picking List generates a list of products to pick, and staff can mark items as picked. The Stock Alerts tab displays all products that have reached or fallen below their minimum threshold. Clicking a product in this tab navigates to its product detail page for restocking or reordering.

### Reporting and Analytics Flow

When the user navigates to Reports, they see categories of reports such as Sales Performance, Inventory Turnover, and Financial Summary. The user selects a report type, which opens a report parameters page. Here they choose date ranges, product categories, or customer filters and click Generate. The system displays the report in a table and chart view on the same page. The user can export the report as CSV or schedule it to be emailed on a regular basis. Scheduled reports appear in a separate tab called Scheduled Reports, where the user can edit or delete schedules.

### Role and User Management Flow

Administrators click User Management in the sidebar to open the Users page. They see a list of users with their roles and statuses. Clicking Create User opens a form where they enter name, email, assign roles, and set an initial password. After creation, the user receives an email to set their password. To change roles or deactivate a user, the administrator clicks Edit on a user row, updates roles or toggles active status, and saves. The Roles page under User Management lists all roles; clicking a role opens a page where the administrator can assign or revoke specific permissions related to features like product editing, quotation approval, or reporting.

## Settings and Account Management

Under Settings in the sidebar, the user finds Personal Profile, Notification Preferences, Company Settings, and API Tokens. In Personal Profile, the user updates their name, email, and uploads an avatar. They can also change their password via a separate form. Notification Preferences allows toggling email or in-app notifications for events like new quotations, approvals needed, and low-stock alerts. Company Settings is only visible to users with the Super Admin role and lets them update company name, address, and logo. API Tokens displays a list of active tokens; the user can create a new token by giving it a name and selecting scopes, then clicking Generate. They copy the token value immediately, and it appears as a masked string in the list. From any settings page, the user returns to the main dashboard by clicking the Dashboard link in the sidebar.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters an incorrect email or password on sign-in, an inline error message appears above the form stating that credentials are invalid. During registration, submitting a form with missing or invalid fields triggers validation messages next to each field. If the user loses network connectivity while performing any action, a banner appears at the top of the page indicating a connection error, and the user can retry once connectivity is restored. Attempting to access a page without the required permission redirects the user to an Access Denied page, which explains why they do not have access and provides a link back to the dashboard. If a server error occurs during an API call, a modal appears with a generic error message and a button to retry the action or contact support.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the very first moment the user signs up and verifies their email, they are guided to a clear dashboard that summarizes the most important metrics. They can then add and manage products, create quotations that flow through a tiered approval process, convert approved quotes into sales orders, and generate invoices. Warehouse staff handle stock receipts, movements, and picking while the system alerts users to low stock. Administrators manage users and roles to ensure security, and everyone can view reports or generate PDFs of critical documents. Throughout daily usage, the user moves seamlessly between creating records, viewing reports, and adjusting settings, all within a consistent layout that keeps the sidebar and header in place. Error messages and access controls keep the experience smooth, and the ability to manage personal and company settings ensures that each user can tailor the system to their needs. By following this flow, a business achieves efficient inventory control, automated sales processing, and accurate financial tracking from end to end.
